# Terraform-and-AWS-Systems-Manager-configuration
Implementation of a set of EC2 instances using Terraform and AWS Systems Manager configuration with Amazon Simple Notification Service for automated installation of security officers

Project description:

In this project based on a real-world scenario, I acted as DevSecOps Engineer, and I deployed a set of EC2 instances and infrastructure in an automated way using Terraform (infrastructure as code - IaC). Also, it was necessary to install a specific security agent on all these instances in an automated way.
Once I provisioned the infrastructure, AWS System Manager and its component Command Run were used to install the security agents in an automated way. I used the Amazon Simple Notification Service â€“ SNS to send an email informing the whole process status.
